# Potholes Detection

## Overview

A Deep Learning based project for detecting potholes in road images. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to build a reliable detector to help with infrastructure monitoring and automated reporting.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: image resizing, normalization, augmentation  
- Deep learning model training (e.g. CNN or custom detection model)  
- Evaluation: metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Visualization of results: sample predictions  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab  
- Key libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `torch`/`tensorflow` (depending on implementation), `opencv-python`, `scikit-learn`

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, you can create one with the needed packages.)

How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ananddddubey/Potholes_Detection.git
cd Potholes_Detection
(Optional) Place your dataset into the data/ folder and adjust notebook paths accordingly.

Open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "DL_project (1).ipynb"
Run through the notebook cells, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Results
Metric	Value
Accuracy	― 98.9%
Precision	―98.4%
Recall	―98.5%
F1-Score	―98.44%


Sample prediction visuals are available in the notebook.

Future Improvements
Use more advanced detection architectures (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN)

Collect a larger, more diverse dataset for better generalizability

Add functionality for real-time camera feed / drone imagery

Deploy as a web or mobile app for field use
